## What is the Reality Co-Processor?
The Reality Co-Processor (RCP) is a specialized chip responsible for graphics and audio processing in the N64. It consists of two main components: the Reality Signal Processor (RSP) and the Reality Display Processor (RDP).

The RCP handles complex graphics calculations, audio, and display output. The RSP manages geometry transformations, audio processing, and general vector operations, while the RDP handles texturing, pixel-level operations, and final image composition.

This coprocessor is what gives the N64 its distinctive, charming, graphics capabilities and allows it to process the complex 3D environments with perspective-correct texture mapping and trilinear filtering.

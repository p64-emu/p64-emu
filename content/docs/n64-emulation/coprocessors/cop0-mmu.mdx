## What is the Memory Management Unit?
The Memory Management Unit is used to set up virtual memory for organising and caching memory, exceptions and interrupts. It has been allocated 32, 32-Bit registers to perform it's operations.

It is composed of a Memory Management Unit and intertwined with the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB). The VR4300 can access at most 4GB of 32-Bit memory addresses. The TLB allows the developers to define their own memory map without a grand cost in performance.

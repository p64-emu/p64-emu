## What is the Floating-Point Unit?
The Floating-Point Unit (FPU) is a specialized coprocessor dedicated to handling floating-point arithmetic operations. It contains 32 floating-point registers, each 64-bits wide, that can be used in both single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) modes.

The FPU manages complex floating-point calculations; addition, multiplication, division, and conversions between different number formats. 

This coprocessor significantly improves the N64's ability to handle 3D graphics calculations and physics simulations by offloading these computations from the main CPU.

description: An overview on the N64's CPU Architecture & The Interplay of Co-Processors

## What is a Co-Processor?
A Co-Processor is a dedicated processor that handles specialised tasks. In the N64's case, this includes; **Memory Managing (MMU)**, **Floating-Point Arithmetic (FPU)**, **Signal Processing (RCP)**.

## Why does the N64's CPU Architecture Include Co-Processors?
The Nintendo 64 uses Co-Processors so that optimising each co-processor is able to be concentrated to the specific co-processor needed. Most of the focus during the creation of the console was to be cost-effective not only in creation but likewise during household use which is what the involvement of co-processors elicit.

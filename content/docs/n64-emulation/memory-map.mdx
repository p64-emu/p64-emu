The Nintendo 64's memory map is key to developing an emulator, as it shows how memory is organized and utilized throughout the system.

## Memory Segments

The system's memory is divided into several segments:

| Region           | Start Address | End Address | Size   | Description                          |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| RDRAM            | 0x00000000   | 0x03FFFFFF | 4-8MB  | Main system memory                   |
| RDRAM Registers  | 0x03F00000   | 0x03FFFFFF | 1MB    | Memory-mapped hardware registers     |
| SP DMEM          | 0x04000000   | 0x04000FFF | 4KB    | Data memory for the RSP              |
| SP IMEM          | 0x04001000   | 0x04001FFF | 4KB    | Instruction memory for the RSP       |
| SP Registers     | 0x04040000   | 0x0404FFFF | 64KB   | Control registers for the RSP        |
| DP Command       | 0x04100000   | 0x041FFFFF | 1MB    | Command registers for the RDP        |
| DP Span          | 0x04200000   | 0x042FFFFF | 1MB    | Span registers for the RDP           |
| MIPS Interface   | 0x04300000   | 0x043FFFFF | 1MB    | Interface registers for the MIPS CPU |
| Video Interface  | 0x04400000   | 0x044FFFFF | 1MB    | Video interface registers            |
| Audio Interface  | 0x04500000   | 0x045FFFFF | 1MB    | Audio interface registers            |
| PI Interface     | 0x04600000   | 0x046FFFFF | 1MB    | Peripheral interface registers       |
| RI Interface     | 0x04700000   | 0x047FFFFF | 1MB    | Interface registers for RDRAM        |
| SI Interface     | 0x04800000   | 0x048FFFFF | 1MB    | Serial interface registers           |
| CartROM          | 0x10000000   | 0x1FBFFFFF | 252MB  | Cartridge ROM                        |
| PIF ROM          | 0x1FC00000   | 0x1FC007BF | 2KB    | Boot ROM                             |
| PIF RAM          | 0x1FC007C0   | 0x1FC007FF | 64B    | Controller and EEPROM interface      |

<Callout title="Important Note">
  The addresses listed above are physical addresses. The Nintendo 64 uses a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) to convert these physical addresses into virtual ones during operation.

## Memory Access

Access to memory on the Nintendo 64 is managed by various controllers:

- **RI (RDRAM Interface):** Oversees access to the main memory.
- **MI (MIPS Interface):** Handles operations related to the CPU.
- **PI (Peripheral Interface):** Manages memory access for cartridges and other peripherals.
- **SI (Serial Interface):** Controls communication with controllers and EEPROMs.

## Virtual Memory

The Nintendo 64â€™s MIPS R4300i CPU uses virtual memory with the following characteristics:

- It supports 32 TLB entries.
- Page sizes range from 4KB to 16MB.
- Both the virtual and physical address spaces are 4GB in size.
